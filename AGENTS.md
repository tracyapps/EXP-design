# EXP [design]

A native macOS design application built around an actual UX workflow — not
feature-count parity with Figma/XD. Guiding principle: **the tool should get
out of the way.** Built with Swift / SwiftUI (app chrome) + AppKit/Core
Graphics (canvas). Xcode 26.3, Swift 6.2, macOS 26 SDK.

## Read these first
- **docs/ROADMAP.md** — scope, architecture decisions, build phases (with
  checkboxes showing what's done), and the Progress Log. This is the project's
  memory. Start here to see what's next.
- **docs/WORKING-AGREEMENT.md** — how the owner and Codex collaborate,
  session/continuity rules, and the owner's communication preferences.

## Working norms (summary — full detail in WORKING-AGREEMENT.md)
- Codex writes code; the owner runs it in Xcode and reports back. The Xcode
  26.3 agent can compile directly.
- Resume work at the next unchecked box in ROADMAP.md. Update the Progress Log
  (newest on top) at the end of every session.
- Accessibility, inclusive design, and tech-ethics are hard requirements, not
  polish. Use "source," never "master." Follow all system accessibility &
  appearance settings (incl. light/dark via semantic colors).
- Be honest about tool limitations. Be reasonably concise.

## Current status
Phase 0 complete: three-pane editor shell runs (HSplitView: layers · canvas ·
inspector, with toolbar toggles and a placeholder artboard). **Next: Phase 1** —
introduce a shared app-state object, then build the real AppKit-backed canvas
with smooth pan/zoom. See ROADMAP.md for the authoritative checklist.
